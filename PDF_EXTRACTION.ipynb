', 'Annex A \\n(informative) \\n \\nClarification\\tof\\tnew\\tstructure,\\tterminology\\tand\\tconcepts\\nA.1 Structure and terminology\\nThe clause structure (i.e. clause sequence) and some of the terminology of this edition of this \\nInternational Standard, in comparison with the previous edition (ISO 9001:2008), have been changed to improve alignment with other management systems standards.\\nThere is no requirement in this International Standard for its structure and terminology to be applied \\nto the documented information of an organization’s quality management system.\\nThe structure of clauses is intended to provide a coherent presentation of requirements, rather than a \\nmodel for documenting an organization’s policies, objectives and processes. The structure and content of documented information related to a quality management system can often be more relevant to its users if it relates to both the processes operated by the organization and information maintained for other purposes.\\nThere is no requirement for the terms used by an organization to be replaced by the terms used in this \\nInternational Standard to specify quality management system requirements. Organizations can choose to use terms which suit their operations (e.g. using “records”, “documentation” or “protocols” rather than “documented information”; or “supplier”, “partner” or “vendor” rather than “external provider”). Table  A.1 shows the major differences in terminology between this edition of this International \\nStandard and the previous edition.\\nTable A.1 — Major differences in terminology between ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 9001:2015\\nISO 9001:2008 ISO 9001:2015\\nProducts Products and services\\nExclusions Not used\\n(See Clause  A.5  for clarification of applicability)\\nManagement representative Not used\\n(Similar responsibilities and authorities are assigned \\nbut no requirement for a single management repre -\\nsentative)\\nDocumentation, quality manual, documented pro -\\ncedures, recordsDocumented information\\nWork environment Environment for the operation of processes\\nMonitoring and measuring equipment Monitoring and measuring resources\\nPurchased product Externally provided products and services\\nSupplier External provider\\nA.2 Products and services\\nISO 9001:2008 used the term “product” to include all output categories. This edition of this International \\nStandard uses “products and services”. “Products and services” include all output categories (hardware, services, software and processed materials). ', 'The specific inclusion of “services” is intended to highlight the differences between products and \\nservices in the application of some requirements. The characteristic of services is that at least part of the output is realized at the interface with the customer. This means, for example, that conformity to requirements cannot necessarily be confirmed before service delivery.\\nIn most cases, products and services are used together. Most outputs that organizations provide to \\ncustomers, or are supplied to them by external providers, include both products and services. For example, a tangible or intangible product can have some associated service or a service can have some associated tangible or intangible product.\\nA.3 Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties\\nSubclause 4.2  specifies requirements for the organization to determine the interested parties that \\nare relevant to the quality management system and the requirements of those interested parties. However, 4.2 does not imply extension of quality management system requirements beyond the scope \\nof this International Standard. As stated in the scope, this International Standard is applicable where an organization needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and aims to enhance customer satisfaction.\\nThere is no requirement in this International Standard for the organization to consider interested \\nparties where it has decided that those parties are not relevant to its quality management system. It is for the organization to decide if a particular requirement of a relevant interested party is relevant to its quality management system.\\nA.4 Risk-based thinking\\nThe concept of risk-based thinking has been implicit in previous editions of this International Standard, e.g. through requirements for planning, review and improvement. This International Standard specifies requirements for the organization to understand its context (see 4.1) and determine risks as \\na basis for planning (see 6.1). This represents the application of risk-based thinking to planning and \\nimplementing quality management system processes (see 4.4) and will assist in determining the extent \\nof documented information.\\nOne of the key purposes of a quality management system is to act as a preventive tool. Consequently, \\nthis International Standard does not have a separate clause or subclause on preventive action. The concept of preventive action is expressed through the use of risk-based thinking in formulating quality management system requirements.\\nThe risk-based thinking applied in this International Standard has enabled some reduction in \\nprescriptive requirements and their replacement by performance-based requirements. There is greater flexibility than in ISO 9001:2008 in the requirements for processes, documented information and \\norganizational responsibilities.\\nAlthough 6.1 specifies that the organization shall plan actions to address risks, there is no requirement \\nfor formal methods for risk management or a documented risk management process. Organizations can \\ndecide whether or not to develop a more extensive risk management methodology than is required by this International Standard, e.g. through the application of other guidance or standards.\\nNot all the processes of a quality management system represent the same level of risk in terms of the \\norganization’s ability to meet its objectives, and the effects of uncertainty are not the same for all \\norganizations. Under the requirements of 6.1 , the organization is responsible for its application of risk-\\nbased thinking and the actions it takes to address risk, including whether or not to retain documented information as evidence of its determination of risks. ', 'A.5 Applicability\\nThis International Standard does not refer to “exclusions” in relation to the applicability of its \\nrequirements to the organization’s quality management system. However, an organization can review the applicability of requirements due to the size or complexity of the organization, the management model it adopts, the range of the organization’s activities and the nature of the risks and opportunities it encounters.\\nThe requirements for applicability are addressed in 4.3, which defines conditions under which an \\norganization can decide that a requirement cannot be applied to any of the processes within the scope \\nof its quality management system. The organization can only decide that a requirement is not applicable if its decision will not result in failure to achieve conformity of products and services.\\nA.6 Documented information\\nAs part of the alignment with other management system standards, a common clause on “documented information” has been adopted without significant change or addition (see 7.5). Where appropriate, \\ntext elsewhere in this International Standard has been aligned with its requirements. Consequently, \\n“documented information” is used for all document requirements.\\nWhere ISO 9001:2008 used specific terminology such as “document” or “documented procedures”, \\n“quality manual” or “quality plan”, this edition of this International Standard defines requirements to \\n“maintain documented information”.\\nWhere ISO 9001:2008 used the term “records” to denote documents needed to provide evidence \\nof conformity with requirements, this is now expressed as a requirement to “retain documented information”. The organization is responsible for determining what documented information needs to \\nbe retained, the period of time for which it is to be retained and the media to be used for its retention.\\nA requirement to “maintain” documented information does not exclude the possibility that the \\norganization might also need to “retain” that same documented information for a particular purpose, e.g. to retain previous versions of it.\\nWhere this International Standard refers to “information” rather than “documented information” (e.g. in \\n4.1: “The organization shall monitor and review the information about these external and internal issues”), \\nthere is no requirement that this information is to be documented. In such situations, the organization can decide whether or not it is necessary or appropriate to maintain documented information.\\nA.7 Organizational knowledge\\nIn 7.1.6 , this International Standard addresses the need to determine and manage the knowledge \\nmaintained by the organization, to ensure the operation of its processes and that it can achieve conformity of products and services.\\nRequirements regarding organizational knowledge were introduced for the purpose of:a) safeguarding the organization from loss of knowledge, e.g.\\n— through staff turnover;\\n— failure to capture and share information;\\nb) encouraging the organization to acquire knowledge, e.g.\\n— learning from experience;\\n— mentoring;\\n— benchmarking. ', 'A.8\\t Control\\tof\\texternally\\tprovided\\tprocesses,\\tproducts\\tand\\tservices\\nAll forms of externally provided processes, products and services are addressed in 8.4, e.g. whether \\nthrough:\\na) purchasing from a supplier;\\nb) an arrangement with an associate company;\\nc) outsourcing processes to an external provider.\\nOutsourcing always has the essential characteristic of a service, since it will have at least one activity \\nnecessarily performed at the interface between the provider and the organization.\\nThe controls required for external provision can vary widely depending on the nature of the processes, \\nproducts and services. The organization can apply risk-based thinking to determine the type and extent of controls appropriate to particular external providers and externally provided processes, products \\nand services. ', 'Annex B  \\n(informative) \\n \\nOther International Standards on quality management and quality \\nmanagement systems developed by ISO/TC 176\\nThe International Standards described in this annex have been developed by ISO/TC 176 to provide \\nsupporting information for organizations that apply this International Standard, and to provide \\nguidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond its requirements.

            "1 Scope This International Standard specifies requirements for a quality management system when an organization: a) needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and b) aims to enhance customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including processes for improvement of the system and the assurance of conformity to customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. All the requirements of this International Standard are generic and are intended to be applicable to any organization, regardless of its type or size, or the products and services it provides. NOTE 1 In this International Standard, the terms “product” or “service” only apply to products and services intended for, or required by, a customer. NOTE 2 Statutory and regulatory requirements can be expressed as legal requirements. 2 Normative references The following documents, in whole or in part, are normatively referenced in this document and are indispensable for its application. For dated references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies. ISO 9000:2015, Quality management systems — Fundamentals and vocabulary 3 Terms and definitions For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in ISO 9000:2015 apply. 4 Context of the organization 4.1 Understanding the organization and its context The organization shall determine external and internal issues that are relevant to its purpose and its strategic direction and that affect its ability to achieve the intended result(s) of its quality management system. The organization shall monitor and review information about these external and internal issues. NOTE 1 Issues can include positive and negative factors or conditions for consideration. NOTE 2 Understanding the external context can be facilitated by considering issues arising from legal, technological, competitive, market, cultural, social and economic environments, whether international, national, regional or local. NOTE 3 Understanding the internal context can be facilitated by considering issues related to values, culture, knowledge and performance of the organization.  4.2 Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties Due to their effect or potential effect on the organization’s ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, the organization shall determine: a) the interested parties that are relevant to the quality management system; b) the requirements of these interested parties that are relevant to the quality management system. The organization shall monitor and review information about these interested parties and their relevant requirements. 4.3 Determining the scope of the quality management system The organization shall determine the boundaries and applicability of the quality management system to establish its scope.

Annex A (informative) Clarification of new structure, terminology and concepts A.1 Structure and terminology The clause structure (i.e. clause sequence) and some of the terminology of this edition of this International Standard, in comparison with the previous edition (ISO 9001:2008), have been changed to improve alignment with other management systems standards. There is no requirement in this International Standard for its structure and terminology to be applied to the documented information of an organization’s quality management system. The structure of clauses is intended to provide a coherent presentation of requirements, rather than a model for documenting an organization’s policies, objectives and processes. The structure and content of documented information related to a quality management system can often be more relevant to its users if it relates to both the processes operated by the organization and information maintained for other purposes. There is no requirement for the terms used by an organization to be replaced by the terms used in this International Standard to specify quality management system requirements. Organizations can choose to use terms which suit their operations (example: using “records”, “documentation” or “protocols” rather than “documented information”; or “supplier”, “partner” or “vendor” rather than “external provider”). Table A.1 shows the major differences in terminology between this edition of this International Standard and the previous edition. Table A.1 — Major differences in terminology between ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 9001:2015 ISO 9001:2008 ISO 9001:2015 Products Products and services Exclusions Not used (See Clause A.5 for clarification of applicability) Management representative Not used (Similar responsibilities and authorities are assigned but no requirement for a single management repre - sentative) Documentation, quality manual, documented pro - cedures, recordsDocumented information Work environment Environment for the operation of processes Monitoring and measuring equipment Monitoring and measuring resources Purchased product Externally provided products and services Supplier External provider A.2 Products and services ISO 9001:2008 used the term “product” to include all output categories. This edition of this International Standard uses “products and services”. “Products and services” include all output categories (hardware, services, software and processed materials). The specific inclusion of “services” is intended to highlight the differences between products and services in the application of some requirements. The characteristic of services is that at least part of the output is realized at the interface with the customer. This means, for example, that conformity to requirements cannot necessarily be confirmed before service delivery. In most cases, products and services are used together. Most outputs that organizations provide to customers, or are supplied to them by external providers, include both products and services. For example, a tangible or intangible product can have some associated service or a service can have some associated tangible or intangible product. A.3 Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties Subclause 4.2 specifies requirements for the organization to determine the interested parties that are relevant to the quality management system and the requirements of those interested parties. However, 4.2 does not imply extension of quality management system requirements beyond the scope of this International Standard. As stated in the scope, this International Standard is applicable where an organization needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and aims to enhance customer satisfaction. There is no requirement in this International Standard for the organization to consider interested parties where it has decided that those parties are not relevant to its quality management system. It is for the organization to decide if a particular requirement of a relevant interested party is relevant to its quality management system. A.4 Risk-based thinking The concept of risk-based thinking has been implicit in previous editions of this International Standard, example: through requirements for planning, review and improvement. This International Standard specifies requirements for the organization to understand its context (see 4.1) and determine risks as a basis for planning (see 6.1). This represents the application of risk-based thinking to planning and implementing quality management system processes (see 4.4) and will assist in determining the extent of documented information. One of the key purposes of a quality management system is to act as a preventive tool. Consequently, this International Standard does not have a separate clause or subclause on preventive action. The concept of preventive action is expressed through the use of risk-based thinking in formulating quality management system requirements. The risk-based thinking applied in this International Standard has enabled some reduction in prescriptive requirements and their replacement by performance-based requirements. There is greater flexibility than in ISO 9001:2008 in the requirements for processes, documented information and organizational responsibilities. Although 6.1 specifies that the organization shall plan actions to address risks, there is no requirement for formal methods for risk management or a documented risk management process. Organizations can decide whether or not to develop a more extensive risk management methodology than is required by this International Standard, example: through the application of other guidance or standards. Not all the processes of a quality management system represent the same level of risk in terms of the organization’s ability to meet its objectives, and the effects of uncertainty are not the same for all organizations. Under the requirements of 6.1 , the organization is responsible for its application of risk- based thinking and the actions it takes to address risk, including whether or not to retain documented information as evidence of its determination of risks. A.5 Applicability This International Standard does not refer to “exclusions” in relation to the applicability of its requirements to the organization’s quality management system. However, an organization can review the applicability of requirements due to the size or complexity of the organization, the management model it adopts, the range of the organization’s activities and the nature of the risks and opportunities it encounters. The requirements for applicability are addressed in 4.3, which defines conditions under which an organization can decide that a requirement cannot be applied to any of the processes within the scope of its quality management system. The organization can only decide that a requirement is not applicable if its decision will not result in failure to achieve conformity of products and services. A.6 Documented information As part of the alignment with other management system standards, a common clause on “documented information” has been adopted without significant change or addition (see 7.5). Where appropriate, text elsewhere in this International Standard has been aligned with its requirements. Consequently, “documented information” is used for all document requirements. Where ISO 9001:2008 used specific terminology such as “document” or “documented procedures”, “quality manual” or “quality plan”, this edition of this International Standard defines requirements to “maintain documented information”. Where ISO 9001:2008 used the term “records” to denote documents needed to provide evidence of conformity with requirements, this is now expressed as a requirement to “retain documented information”. The organization is responsible for determining what documented information needs to be retained, the period of time for which it is to be retained and the media to be used for its retention. A requirement to “maintain” documented information does not exclude the possibility that the organization might also need to “retain” that same documented information for a particular purpose, example: to retain previous versions of it. Where this International Standard refers to “information” rather than “documented information” (example: in 4.1: “The organization shall monitor and review the information about these external and internal issues”), there is no requirement that this information is to be documented. In such situations, the organization can decide whether or not it is necessary or appropriate to maintain documented information. A.7 Organizational knowledge In 7.1.6 , this International Standard addresses the need to determine and manage the knowledge maintained by the organization, to ensure the operation of its processes and that it can achieve conformity of products and services. Requirements regarding organizational knowledge were introduced for the purpose of:a) safeguarding the organization from loss of knowledge, example: — through staff turnover; — failure to capture and share information; b) encouraging the organization to acquire knowledge, example: — learning from experience; — mentoring; — benchmarking. A.8 Control of externally provided processes, products and services All forms of externally provided processes, products and services are addressed in 8.4, example: whether through: a) purchasing from a supplier; b) an arrangement with an associate company; c) outsourcing processes to an external provider. Outsourcing always has the essential characteristic of a service, since it will have at least one activity necessarily performed at the interface between the provider and the organization. The controls required for external provision can vary widely depending on the nature of the processes, products and services. The organization can apply risk-based thinking to determine the type and extent of controls appropriate to particular external providers and externally provided processes, products and services. Annex B (informative) Other International Standards on quality management and quality management systems developed by ISO/TC 176 The International Standards described in this annex have been developed by ISO/TC 176 to provide supporting information for organizations that apply this International Standard, and to provide guidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond its requirements. Guidance or requirements contained in the documents listed in this annex do not add to, or modify, the requirements of this International Standard. Table B.1 shows the relationship between these standards and the relevant clauses of this International Standard.This annex does not include reference to the sector-specific quality management system standards developed by ISO/TC 176. This International Standard is one of the three core standards developed by ISO/TC 176. — ISO 9000 Quality management systems — Fundamentals and vocabulary provides an essential background for the proper understanding and implementation of this International Standard. The quality management principles are described in detail in ISO 9000 and have been taken into consideration during the development of this International Standard. These principles are not requirements in themselves, but they form the foundation of the requirements specified by this International Standard. ISO 9000 also defines the terms, definitions and concepts used in this International Standard. — ISO 9001 (this International Standard) specifies requirements aimed primarily at giving confidence in the products and services provided by an organization and thereby enhancing customer satisfaction. Its proper implementation can also be expected to bring other organizational benefits, such as improved internal communication, better understanding and control of the organization’s processes. — ISO 9004 Managing for the sustained success of an organization — A quality management approach provides guidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond the requirements of this International Standard, to address a broader range of topics that can lead to improvement of the organization’s overall performance. ISO 9004 includes guidance on a self-assessment methodology for an organization to be able to evaluate the level of maturity of its quality management system. The International Standards outlined below can provide assistance to organizations when they are establishing or seeking to improve their quality management systems, their processes or their activities. — ISO 10001 Quality management — Customer satisfaction — Guidelines for codes of conduct for organizations provides guidance to an organization in determining that its customer satisfaction provisions meet customer needs and expectations. Its use can enhance customer confidence in an organization and improve customer understanding of what to expect from an organization, thereby reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings and complaints. — ISO 10002 Quality management — Customer satisfaction — Guidelines for complaints handling in organizations provides guidance on the process of handling complaints by recognizing and addressing the needs and expectations of complainants and resolving any complaints received. ISO 10002 provides an open, effective and easy-to-use complaints process, including training of people. It also provides guidance for small businesses. — ISO 10003 Quality management — Customer satisfaction — Guidelines for dispute resolution external to organizations provides guidance for effective and efficient external dispute resolution for product-related complaints. Dispute resolution gives an avenue of redress when organizations do not remedy a complaint internally. Most complaints can be resolved successfully within the organization, without adversarial procedures. — ISO 10004 Quality management — Customer satisfaction — Guidelines for monitoring and measuring provides guidelines for actions to enhance customer satisfaction and to determine opportunities for improvement of products, processes and attributes that are valued by customers. Such actions can strengthen customer loyalty and help retain customers. — ISO 10005 Quality management systems — Guidelines for quality plans provides guidance on establishing and using quality plans as a means of relating requirements of the process, product, project or contract, to work methods and practices that support product realization. Benefits of establishing a quality plan are increased confidence that requirements will be met, that processes are in control and the motivation that this can give to those involved. — ISO 10006 Quality management systems — Guidelines for quality management in projects is applicable to projects from the small to large, from simple to complex, from an individual project to being part of a portfolio of projects. ISO 10006 is to be used by personnel managing projects and who need to ensure that their organization is applying the practices contained in the ISO quality management system standards. — ISO 10007 Quality management systems — Guidelines for configuration management is to assist organizations applying configuration management for the technical and administrative direction over the life cycle of a product. Configuration management can be used to meet the product identification and traceability requirements specified in this International Standard. — ISO 10008 Quality management — Customer satisfaction — Guidelines for business-to-consumer electronic commerce transactions gives guidance on how organizations can implement an effective and efficient business-to-consumer electronic commerce transaction (B2C ECT) system, and thereby provide a basis for consumers to have increased confidence in B2C ECTs, enhance the ability of organizations to satisfy consumers and help reduce complaints and disputes. — ISO 10012 Measurement management systems — Requirements for measurement processes and measuring equipment provides guidance for the management of measurement processes and metrological confirmation of measuring equipment used to support and demonstrate compliance with metrological requirements. ISO 10012 provides quality management criteria for a measurement management system to ensure metrological requirements are met. — ISO/TR 10013 Guidelines for quality management system documentation provides guidelines for the development and maintenance of the documentation necessary for a quality management system. ISO/TR 10013 can be used to document management systems other than those of the ISO quality management system standards, example: environmental management systems and safety management systems. — ISO 10014 Quality management — Guidelines for realizing financial and economic benefits is addressed to top management. It provides guidelines for realizing financial and economic benefits through the application of quality management principles. It facilitates application of management principles and selection of methods and tools that enable the sustainable success of an organization. — ISO 10015 Quality management — Guidelines for training provides guidelines to assist organizations in addressing issues related to training. ISO 10015 can be applied whenever guidance is required to interpret references to “education” and “training” within the ISO quality management system standards. Any reference to “training” includes all types of education and training. — ISO/TR 10017 Guidance on statistical techniques for ISO 9001:2000 explains statistical techniques which follow from the variability that can be observed in the behaviour and results of processes, even under conditions of apparent stability. Statistical techniques allow better use of available data to assist in decision making, and thereby help to continually improve the quality of products and processes to achieve customer satisfaction. — ISO 10018 Quality management — Guidelines on people involvement and competence provides guidelines which influence people involvement and competence. A quality management system depends on the involvement of competent people and the way that they are introduced and integrated into the organization. It is critical to determine, develop and evaluate the knowledge, skills, behaviour and work environment required. — ISO 10019 Guidelines for the selection of quality management system consultants and use of their services provides guidance for the selection of quality management system consultants and the use of their services. It gives guidance on the process for evaluating the competence of a quality management system consultant and provides confidence that the organization’s needs and expectations for the consultant’s services will be met. — ISO 19011 Guidelines for auditing management systems provides guidance on the management of an audit programme, on the planning and conducting of an audit of a management system, as well as on the competence and evaluation of an auditor and an audit team.
